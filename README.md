# Andrea Zampetti's website

## 🌐 Making the Website Public

Your GitHub Pages site is already configured and building successfully! To make it publicly accessible at **https://andrewzamp.github.io**, you need to make the repository public:

### Steps to make your website public:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/andrewzamp/andrewzamp.github.io
2. Click on **Settings** (gear icon in the top menu)
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom
4. Click **Change repository visibility**
5. Select **Make public**
6. Type the repository name to confirm and click **I understand, make this repository public**

After making the repository public, your website will be automatically accessible at: **https://andrewzamp.github.io**

> **Note:** For personal GitHub Pages sites (username.github.io), the repository typically needs to be public for the website to be publicly accessible. If you have GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise, you can alternatively keep the repository private and enable public Pages visibility in Settings > Pages.
